| ![Status: Draft](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Draft-orange) | The relation interface specification is still being worked on and might still go through breaking changes. Not yet ready to depend on in live production charms. |
| ![Status: Live](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Live-darkgreen) | The relation interface speficiation has reached enough maturity to no longer be likely to change drastically without prior notice. Any changes to the schema from this point on will require bumping the interface version. |
| ![Status: Retired](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Retired-inactive) | The relation interface speficiation has been retired and will no longer be under active maintenance or development. If it has been superseded by another specification, the retired specification should link to the replacement. |
